# Rumble-Mod-Manager
- You can download the latest version [here](https://github.com/xLoadingx/Rumble-Mod-Manager/releases)

## Important Notes

- **Backup your data**: Always a good practice to back up important files before trying new software. I'm working on adding automatic data backup to the manager soon.
- **File Handling**: The mod manager involves managing files (obviously). It's designed to be safe, but your feedback will help ensure everything is smooth.
- **Community Review**: Feel free to give your input and contribute towards making the manager better.

Please keep in mind this is my first time making a program like this. I am not good at this by any means. Your constructive feedback and suggestions would be extremely valuable as I work on refining and enhancing the project.

# System Requirements
- NET 8 or higher is required to run this application. You can download that [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- This application is only compatible with Windows.

## How To Use

1. **Initial Setup**: When you first open the manager, you might see a message saying "Path not found." Select the appropriate path.
   - Once your RUMBLE path is found, you should see some buttons appear. If the path is found automatically, you can close the settings menu. If not, set your RUMBLE path manually (this is where your `RUMBLE.exe` is located).
   
2. **Launching the Manager**:
   - Click "Launch." The manager will fetch the mods from Thunderstore. If you already have the custom maps mod installed, it will fetch the maps as well.
   - Once everything is set up, you're good to go!

3. **Installing Mods**:
   - Click the Thunderstore button in the bottom right to install mods from the internet.
   - Reinstalling a mod on the Thunderstore page will update the mod.
     - You can also update mods by selecting one in the main menu and clicking on the cloud icon next to the version number on the top right.
     - **Color Indicators**:
       - **Blue**: Future version installed
       - **Green**: Up to date
       - **Red**: Out of date
   - You can check if a mod is out of date by looking at the square in the bottom right corner of each mod.

4. **Managing Local Mods**:
   - Click on one of the panels on the left of the main menu to see the details of your local mods (the ones you have installed).
     - If the mod is not recognized (e.g., downloaded from somewhere else or if the DLL file is not named clearly), it may show as "Unknown."
   - This panel displays the name, description, last updated date, dependencies, version, icon, and several buttons:
     - **Toggle**: Turn the mod on or off.
     - **Uninstall**: Remove the mod by clicking "Uninstall" and confirming in the popup window.

5. **Settings**:
   - Change your settings by clicking the gear icon next to the Thunderstore button.
  
### Custom Maps

1. **Install the CustomMultiplayerMaps Mod:**
   - In the mod manager, click the Thunderstore button and install the `CustomMultiplayerMaps` mod by UlvakSkillz.
   - After installation, a "Custom Maps" button will appear in the manager.

2. **Download and Install Maps:**
   - Click the "Custom Maps" button, select a map, and click "Install."

3. **Using Custom Maps:**
   - For detailed instructions, visit the mod's [Thunderstore page](https://thunderstore.io/c/rumble/p/UlvakSkillz/CustomMultiplayerMaps/).

## MelonLoader Installation

If this is your first time modding RUMBLE and you don't have MelonLoader installed, don't worry! The mod manager will install it for you. Just follow the instructions carefully:

1. If you dont have MelonLoader installed, just click the launch button (after finding your path)
   - After fetching the mods, it should start to install MelonLoader

2. Once MelonLoader is installed, it will launch the game. (*Make sure to read the popup first*).
   - Ensure you see the MelonLoader start screen when the game opens.
   - Wait until the game reaches the T-pose screen (where the RUMBLE man is standing with arms outstretched).
   - Once you see that, close the game, and the mod manager should open.

3. Congratulations! You have successfully modded RUMBLE!
